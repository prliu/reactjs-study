# React Study Side Project

This project is my own side project for studying React.js framework.

It may not be a workable APP. Everytime after I read books or information from the internet, I will put some new ideas in this project.

# TODO

Now, the APP is working fine, but I still not use the Redux framework. I'm considering to implement Redux in this APP.
